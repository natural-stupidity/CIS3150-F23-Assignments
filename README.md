### Year: 2023
All of the assignments for CIS 3150 (Theory of Computation) at the University of Guelph 

**Assignment 1** - Nondeterministic Finite Automata "Parser"<br/>
**Assignment 2** - Recursive Regular Expression (Regex) Parser<br/>
**Assignment 3** - Recursive Regex to Descending Tree Parser<br/>
**Assignment 4** - Simple Interpreter<br/>

Note: I redid Assignment 2 after the semester to make it better than what I submitted which is why the date is different.

## Technical Details:
All assignments are made with C. Assignments 3 and 4 use the ncurses library.<br/>
